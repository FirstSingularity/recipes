## Instructions

1. Trim fat off of the chicken thighs, then flatten them with a mallet.
1. Prepare the brine, then brine the chicken for a minimum of 30 mins (up to 24 hours). Steps 1-2 should ideally be finished well before when the meal is planned for. (After brining, make sure the chicken is not dripping wet with brine). 
1. Dice the onions and carrots. Mince/crush the garlic.
1. Set aside three plates, one with flour, one with beaten egg, and one with panko. Dredge the brined chicken in the flour (shake off excess), dip the chicken in egg, and then press panko into the chicken until coated. Set the chicken aside.
1. Sautée the onions and carrots, add salt immediately after adding the onions and carrots to the pot.
1. Once the onions begin to sweat, add the garlic and the garam masala, chili/chili powder, cumin, and coriander and let the spices bloom in the oil.
1. After the onions become slightly translucent, deglaze the pot with wine. Let the alcohol cook off for a bit while stirring. (Optional)
1. Add stock and stir until the stock is heated.
1. Start heating the oil for frying; you can drop breadcrumbs into the oil to tell if it is ready (it should bubble, but not too aggressively).
1. Start cooking the rice with a small amount of rice vinegar and a dash of salt.
1. Add all the curry roux and stir until it is evenly combined into the stock. Throughout the process, add stock or water to thin out the curry if needed.
1. Add the black pepper and stir. Do not cook for too long, as the onions will dissolve. Take the pot off the heat if necessary.
1. Once the oil is ready, fry one piece of chicken at a time. Make sure the oil is completely covers the chicken. Fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, and then move the chicken to a wire-rack or tray with paper towels. Aim for a very light golden color.
1. Once all the chicken has gone through one round of frying, refry the chicken for another ~1 minute per side and aim for a golden brown. Keep sure the temperature of the oil stays constant. Keep in mind that the chicken will continue cooking for a few minutes after frying, so make sure you remove it before any dark brown appears.
1. After letting the chicken rest for ~5 minutes, it is time to serve. Cover half the plate with rice, and cover the other half with curry. Cut the chicken into strips then move it onto the plate onto the border of the curry and rice. Finally, add garnish to one part of the rice and crushed fenugreek to the curry, if using.
